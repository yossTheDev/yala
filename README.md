## üí° The IDEA

The idea behind **Yala** is to create a package manager more intuitive, beautiful, and with additional features to make our life easier. Like Inspecting Packages, Advanced Logs, Unlocking Databases, Clearing Package Cache and more, some are already implemented and others are still to come.

## üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Building From Source

First, make sure all dependencies are sucefully installed, I recommend [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for enviroment configuration.

### Prepare Enviroment and Installing Dependencies

``` sh
poetry install
```

### Building with **PyInstaller**

Tested with **Python 3.11** and [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org) **5.13.0**

``` sh
bash build.sh
```

### Building with **Nuitka**

Longer compile time but best performance and smaller compiled size. See [Nuitka Requirements](https://www.nuitka.net/doc/user-manual.html#requirements)

Installing Nuitka:

``` sh
python -m pip install nuitka  
```

Tested with **Python 3.11** and **Nuitka 1.7**

``` sh
bash build_nuitka.sh
```
